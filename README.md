A Knight’s Errant is a procedurally generated 2D open-world RPG style adventure & exploration game, inspired by the likes of Minecraft, Dungeon Crawlers and Forager. The maps and biomes are procedurally generated. A map has different biomes (terrains) each having different kinds of resources, enemies, traps and bandits. The adventure is about a main character, a knight on his mission to attain power, resources and knowledge of it’s mysterious world. The main character progresses through the game by gaining experience by gathering resources, gaining different kinds of abilities, trading, exploring and of course slaying enemies.
