>## INTRODUCTION
***
```
A Knightâ€™s Errant is a procedurally generated 2D open-world RPG style adventure & exploration game, inspired by the likes of Minecraft, Dungeon Crawlers and Forager.
The maps and biomes are procedurally generated.
A map has different biomes (terrains) each having different kinds of resources, enemies, traps and bandits.
